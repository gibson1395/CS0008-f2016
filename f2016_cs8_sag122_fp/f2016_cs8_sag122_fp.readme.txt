The assignment gave me trouble when trying to incorporate the new methods.
I had a mixture of your and my program, but there were substantial errors I could not seem to figure out.
Once all was said and done, I was able to create the initial requirements but had trouble with the
__str__() and getting the name, distance, and runs. I was unsure how to get that information
as it is similar to the output file with different formatting. I really tried to use the book for examples, but there
were no similar examples found that used data files. Just wanted to clarify so you could more efficiently look over the program.

Thanks and have a great winter break,
